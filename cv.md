I'am power engineer. I work as a dispatcher in the Central Asian power system. I want to develop as a specialist at the intersection of energy and IT.
   
I didn't work in IT
  
I completed my bachelor's degree at TSTU with a degree in Electrical Power Engineering.

I have basic HTML, CSS and JS skills from studying at RSSchool 2021 but unfortunately I could not complete the course.

My English level is now A2.
